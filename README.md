# Deep Learning In Production

### About this Repo

Deep Learning research is advancing rapidly over the past years. Frameworks and libraries are constantly been developed and updated. However, we still lack standardized solutions on how to serve, deploy and scale Deep Learning models. Deep Learning infrastructure is not very mature yet.

This repo accumulates a set of best practices and approaches on how to build robust and scalable machine learning applications. It covers the entire lifecycle from data processing and training to deployment and maintenance. It will help you understand how to transfer methodologies that are generally accepted and applied in the software community, into Deep Learning projects.

It's an excellent choice for researchers with a minimal software background, software engineers with little experience in machine learning, or aspiring machine learning engineers.


**What you will learn?**

- Best practices to write Deep Learning code
- How to unit test and debug Machine Learning code
- How to build and deploy efficient data pipelines
- How to serve Deep Learning models
- How to deploy and scale your application
- What is MLOps and how to build end-to-end pipelines


**What tools you will use?**

Tensorflow, Flask, uWSGI, Nginx, Docker, Kubernetes, Tensorflow Extended, Google Cloud, Vertex AI

So, you will build, train, deploy, scale and maintain deep learning models. Understand ML infrastructure and MLOps using hands-on examples!
